# Week 7 #
This is the sixth of my blog posts for DIGH5000, though it is the seventh (eight?) week. Last week was Reading Week, so I've lost track of which weeks count as weeks. This week, we're focusing on archives and databases as well as digital writing.

There are several readings assigned, with a few choices. For archives and databases, we have the option of:

1. "Feminist Research Practices and Digital Archives," by Michelle Moravec, https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/08164649.2017.1357006?casa_token=xXX0htmGn9EAAAAA:DkNE4TKF8lR-Wwg6QGsX7f918cQvApWd30o0W5wUVi9Ah970M3tD3AXPMet6ZfCLigT8g6tkA2TnJQ
2. “Teaching Personal Digital Archiving through Community Digitization,” by Maggie Schreiner, https://saaers.wordpress.com/2018/02/12/teaching-personal-digital-archiving-through-community-digitization/ 
3. Krista McCracken, Historical Reminiscents: Episode 55: Community Based Digitization, https://kristamccracken.ca/?p=2471 
4. Deanna Bowen: Death To/Long Live: THE ARCHIVE (18 minutes), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGNaSNl9uWw&t=910s&ab_channel=KofflerCentreoftheArts 
5. South London Black Music Archive: http://www.peckhamplatform.com/whats-on/exhibitions/south-london-black-music-archive#video-south-london-black-music-archive-video 

For digital writing, we were assigned one reading:

1. Digital Writing in English Language Instruction, Yee Bee Choo and Kee Li Li, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328493053_Digital_Writing_in_English_Language_Writing_Instruction


# Archives and Databases #
## Moravec ##

In this reading the author raises several important questions about the digitization of archives from a feminist perspective, including: "Have the individuals whose work appears in these materials consented to this? Whose labour was used and how is it acknowledged? What absences must be attended to among an abundance of materials?" (Moravec). These are important questions, and I've put them here for my own rememberance when digitizing.

## Schreiner ##

This reading is about the 'Queens Memory' program at CUNY, out of Queens Library and Queens College. According to the author, it's a public digitization program where the public can contribute their own items to be digitized and added to the collection. In return, they get a USB with the digitized material, along with their original artifacts/objects. I think that this is really cool, and I also think it's both interesting and important that upon recognizing that many contributors did not understand the USB sticks, they started creating digital literacy programs. 

# Digital Writing #
## Choo and Li ##

This reading focuses on the need to keep kids engaged when teaching writing. Based on a study with student-teachers in Malaysia, they determined that students were more interested and engaged when teaching digital writing as opposed to traditional writing. Through the use of images and storytelling via digital means, students paid more attention and also enjoyed it more.
