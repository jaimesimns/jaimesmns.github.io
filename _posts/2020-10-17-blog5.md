# Week 6 #
This is the fifth of my blog posts for DIGH5000, though it is the sixth week. This week, we're focusing on mapping and network analysis, both of which promise to be extremely interesting.

There are several readings assigned, with a few choices. For mapping, we have the option of:

1. Caquard, Sébastien. "Cartography I: Mapping narrative cartography." Progress in Human Geography 37, no. 1 (2011): 135-144. 
 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0309132511423796
2. Kwan, Mei-Po. “From Oral Histories to Visual Narratives: Re-Presenting the Post-September 11 Experiences of the Muslim Women in the USA.” Social and Cultural Geography 9 no. 6 (2008): 653-669.

As well as the option to check out several applications of mapping, including:

1. The mobile app 'Whose Land'
2. Mapping LGBT+ Bristol: https://outstoriesbristol.org.uk/map/#osb/kyp/205
3. Map of Mass Graves: https://mapadefosas.mjusticia.es/exovi_externo/CargarInformacion.htm

For network analysis, we were assigned one reading, with the option of an additional reading

1. Weingart, Scott (2011) “Demystifying Networks. Part 1” http://www.scottbot.net/HIAL/index.html@p=6279.html
