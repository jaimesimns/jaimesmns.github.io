This article discusses Dove's "Campaign for Real Beauty," examined as beauty through performance. It's been several years since I've seen the material discussed in the article, but some critiques that I remember about this campaign were the lack of disability representation and the lack of trans representation. I don't think anyone was visibily disabled in the ads, and nor do I recall any trans women or gender-nonconforming femmes. I think they also only included light-skin or lighter-skin people of colour, and I recall very few birthmarks or moles (but there were freckles, which are considered more attractive). In general, the people shown were also still conventionally attractive (which is a point made later in the article). While it included a variety of body sizes and skin colours, the advertisements still lacked a lot true diversity. The article draws from interviews with sixteen Canadian women. One thing that I liked about the article was that the author firmly stated their posisition of being a woman and coming from Western-ized beauty standards. It would have been nice if she had also stated that she was a white woman, as further research revealed, as that is also important. However, I do like this newer trend of authors explicitly stating their positioning in regards to their research.
