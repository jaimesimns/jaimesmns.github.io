Hi! My name is Jaime, and I'm an M.A. Candidate in Public History at Carleton University. This website is meant as an open notebook for my academic work and projects. 

### More Information

My research interests focus on virtual reality and archaeology, soundscapes, site-specific practice, and museum education, accessibility, and interactivity.
