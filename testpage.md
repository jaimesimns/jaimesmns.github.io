Hi! My name is Jaime, and I'm an M.A. Candidate in Public History at Carleton University. This website is meant as an open notebook for my public-facing academic work and projects. It may also include some random writing as I try to figure out GitHub.

### More Information

My research interests focus on virtual reality and archaeology, public history, soundscapes, site-specific practice, exhibit curation, and museum education, accessibility, and interactivity.
